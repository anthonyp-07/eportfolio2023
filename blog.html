<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The Boston Bruins Breakdown. What Comes Next?</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The 2023-2024 NHL season is finally underway as a very busy offseason of trades, injuries, draft picks and more. The Vegas Golden Knights come back as defending champions after beating the Florida Panthers for their first Stanley Cup Championship in the young franchise’s history. But the Golden Knights win wasn’t the only major buzz coming from the playoffs back in June. The Boston Bruins, which came into the playoffs with an absolutely historic regular season, filled with the best regular season record in the NHL has ever seen, failed to even get past the first round of the playoffs for the third year in a row. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENED?</strong></p>
<p>The Bruins were nearly unstoppable in the 2022-23 season, with an unbelievable 65-12-5 record and ending their regular season on a 9-game win streak, the hopes and goals of the team and the city were incredibly high. Sadly, for those who know history in the NHL, the team that wins the President’s Trophy (awarded to the team with the most points at the end of the regular season) very rarely goes onto win the Stanley Cup. History seemed to repeat itself once again as the over 12-year drought of Stanley Cups in Boston continued after the Bruins fell to the bottom seeded Florida Panthers in 7 games. The series that many experts and commentators predicted to be a “warm up series” for the Bruins as they were to move further into the playoffs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MOVING FORWARD. </strong></p>
<p>After the shocking loss to the Panthers, it left a lot of questions to be answered of whether or not this team was truly just a lucky fluke, or they were legit. To have such a dominate season as they did, to then lose to a scrappy and struggling Panthers team left a sour taste in all of Boston’s mouth. It also left a lot of questions to be asked of the roster moving into the following season, Patrice Bergeron the captain for the Bruins for many seasons, saw the loss as a reason to officially hang up his skates after playing in the league for almost 20 years. Also, to make matters worse, after the 2021-2022 season, the Bruins fired their coach Bruce Cassidy in a shocking change. Cassidy would then be hired by the Vegas Golden Knights and took them all the way to winning the Stanley Cup.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>THE SEASON SO FAR. </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Preseason </strong></p>
<p>The Bruins played 6 preseason games as they geared up for their 2023-2024 campaign, thankfully the preseason doesn’t count for anything or else the season was going to be a long one. Winning only 2 of their 6 games, both coming against the New York Rangers, they were looking rough. Now many know that the preseason is the time to try out new things and give the young guys on the roster some time on the ice, but many were hoping that their performance in the preseason wasn’t going to reflect their in-season form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Game 1 – Season Opener v. Chicago Blackhawks (0-0)</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The first game of the season is always a special one, it’s the first time that everyone gets to see what the team can truly do. Filled with lots of expectations, especially after coming off the highs that the Bruins were from last season, Boston was expecting a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bruins were ready to play in their season opener, coming out red hot against the Hawks. However, it didn’t take long for the Hawks to open the scoring in the first 5 mins from standout rookie Connor Bedard scores his first career NHL goal. Boston came right back scoring 5 minutes later after Trent Frederic opened Boston’s season scoring. (1-1) The second period was all Boston, and the momentum paid off after Milan Lucic fed David Pastrnak for the go-ahead goal. A great cross crease pass out to the wing followed by some fancy stick handling by Pastrnak to snipe it top corner past the Hawks goaltender. (2-1) The go-ahead goal was all the Bruins needed going into the third period as they a comfortable bit of control, holding off the aggressive Chicago surge late in the third. Finally, with less than a minute to play in the game, Pastrnak put the nail in the coffin scoring the empty netter to seal the game for the Bruins and start the season off with a big win and set the pace for the rest of the season. (3-1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Game 2 – Tug-of-war v. Nashville Predators (1-0)</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A few days later after their season opening win against Chicago, the Bruins were back on the ice in Boston to take on the Nashville Predators. This game was going to be a wildcard as the Preds have always been a strange back-and-forth team depending on the season. None the less, the goal was still the same for the Bruins, win and move on to the next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Preds were ready for this difficult game, coming out early to open the scoring after only 4 mins to take a quick 1-0 lead. The Bruins fought it back in the first period to even the score after James van Riemsdyk netted the tying goal. (1-1) The Bruins would then go on to take the lead late in the second period after David Pastrnak scores his third on the season. Pastrnak was brought down on a trip during an earlier shot leading to the lead referee to award the Bruins a penalty shot. However, the lead wouldn’t last long as the Preds would come back to even the scoring 2 mins later. (2-2). Despite the Preds out playing the Bruins in the third period, they were still able to find a go-ahead goal early in the third period. (3-2) the Bruins were able to hold off the preds for the remainder of the third period to go on to win the game 3-2, moving them to a 2-0 record to start the season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Game 3 – On the Road Out West v. San Jose Sharks (2-0) </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Bruins started their 3 game California road trip in San Jose against a wildcard Sharks team that if they could get things together, they could be a team making a run in the post season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This game was a dominance from the Bruins, after having a slower start to the first period Brad Marchand gets his first of the season late in the first period. (1-0) Then, not even 30 seconds later van Riemsdyk gets his third of the season to double the Bruins lead late in the first period. (2-0) David Pastrnak would get his fourth of the season coming in the second period as he scores late to put the Bruins up three. (3-0) The Sharks were able to steal one back from the B’s halfway through the third period, but it wasn’t going to be enough as the lead assembled earlier in the game was too tough for the Sharks to overcome. (3-1) The B’s closed out the game despite being out possessed by the Sharks to win the game 3-1 and started off their road trip with a win. They also improved to a 3-0 record on the season headed to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Game 4 – There’s New Kings in Town v. Los Angeles Kings (3-0) </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After their dominant win against the Sharks, the B’s traveled south to Los Angeles to take on the Kings. A team that has won a Stanley Cup in the time since the Bruins have won their last back in 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pastrnak would get the B’s on the board in the first period tallying his fifth on the year. (1-0) The Kings would bring it back in the second period to tie the game after some excessive pressure in front of goal. (1-1) But it didn’t take long for the Bruins to regain the lead after Morgan Geekie gets his first of the season. (2-1) Brad Marchand would add to that total less than a minute later, doubling the Bruins lead and marking his second on the season. (3-1) The third period would be slow for both teams as it was clear players were getting tired. It wasn’t until in the last 2 mins that Marchand would get another goal to take the Bruins lead even further, getting him to his third on the season. (4-1) The Kings would claw one back a minute later but there just was not enough time to do anything about it and the Bruins were able to take it to the horn and close out the game with another win 4-1.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Bruins have started off the season incredibly well. But for most fans having a start like this would be a dream, but to Boston fans, its expected. Coming off a heartbreaking finish to last year’s record-breaking season, this start is exactly what fans want to see. Some NHL analysists are already predicting that the Bruins are going to go all the way and finish what they started last season. The season is still early and there are over 75 games still to play in the regular season which means there is plenty of time for things to happen for better or for worse.</p>
